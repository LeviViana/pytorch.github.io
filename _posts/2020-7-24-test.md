## Disney's Content Genome
The long and incremental evolution of the media industry, from a traditional broadcast and home video model, to more readily-accessible digital content, has accelerated the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Advancing the implementation of these technologies is critical for a company like Disney that has produced nearly a century of content, as it allows for new consumer experiences and enables new applications for illustrators and writers to create the highest-quality content.

In response to this industry shift, Disney's Content Genome was built by a team of R&D engineers and information scientists within Disney's Direct-to-Consumer & International Organization (DTCI) to power new applications for digital product innovation, and create a comprehensive digital archive. The platform populates knowledge graphs with content metadata, which powers AI applications across search, personalization, and production operations, all of which are critical components of digital video platforms. This metadata improves tools that are used to produce content; powers user experiences through recommendation engines, digital navigation and discovery; and enables business intelligence and analytics.
